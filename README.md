# sofunCalVal

Provides basic benchmarking and supporting visualization tools for the
rsofun package. The package is meant for internal lab use only but might
serve others as well (however limited support is provided). Keep in mind
that some of the workflow is dependent on internal compute infrastructure
limiting the use of benchmarks.
